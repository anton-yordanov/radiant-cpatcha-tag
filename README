= Custom Tags

= Very basic and simple cpatcha that can be used in forms.
= <r:cpatcha><r:cpatcha_key></r:cpatcha>


CPATCHA that are used: http://captchator.com/

How to install extention: https://github.com/radiant/radiant/wiki/Installing-Extensions#wiki-manual

Custom tags : /app/models/custom_tags.rb

Using with Mailer extention: git://gist.github.com/1226154.git

I think that this is not very good solution but I'm not familiar with Radiant
